  # courseOverview: The Intro to Machine Learning with Pytorch program covers machine learning concepts and techniques, with a focus on supervised and unsupervised learning. The program includes three courses and covers topics such as linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, Naive Bayes, support vector machines, neural networks, and clustering. The courses include projects that allow learners to apply these techniques to real-world problems, such as identifying potential donors for a charity and clustering customers based on their spending habits. The program uses Python and PyTorch for implementation and includes lessons on model evaluation and tuning.
