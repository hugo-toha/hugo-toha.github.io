# a summary about you
summary: 'I have 2 years of consulting experience in life science during which I found my passion in IT and decided to enroll in the M.Sc. program in Medical Informatics. During various student projects I have used Python and R and applied Artificial Intelligence algorithms to various datasets. As part of a student team, I contributed to the development of a full stack medical software. I am CSPO certified. As a hobby I have played around with the MERN stack, HTML and CSS. I am currently looking for an entry level IT position within a SCRUM team, or a traineeship or internship as a Data scientist or Software developer. I am looking for a master thesis topic to begin in February 2023 as well.'
