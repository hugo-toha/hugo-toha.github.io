# a summary about you
summary: 'Hello! I am an extremely curious and passionate Computer Science Student with under a year of experience working in the AAA Gaming Industry. I have previously worked on [Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War](https://www.callofduty.com/blackopscoldwar) & [Call of Duty: Warzone](https://www.callofduty.com/warzone) in a QA Functional Game Tester capacity. I learned many new and interesting skills during my time with [Activision](https://www.activision.com/) as well as sparking a real interest in actually breaking into the Video Game Industry. I am currently located in Menomonie, WI or possibly visiting back home in the Twin Cities Metro Area. For any internship opportunities I am willing to relocate for the duration of the position.'
