# a summary about you
summary: 'I consider myself a selective perfectionist and an avid lifelong learner who actively pursues and embraces new challenges to broaden my knowledge and refine my skills to the fullest extent possible, often with a playful approach. My lasting fascination with artificial intelligence, its profound impact on societal issues, and its potential for societal benefit runs deepâ€”and likely always will. Therefore, I aim to contribute to a brighter future by sharing my insights with the computer vision & deep learning community.'
