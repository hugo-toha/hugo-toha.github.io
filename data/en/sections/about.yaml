# a summary about you
summary: You know how everyone talks about data but few actually make it useful? That's where I come in -- **I take messy data and turn them into real-world solutions that tell a story -- YOUR STORY**. At Blue Cross, I rewrote our SQL reports to run 94% faster so our doctors could actually use patient data in time to help people. Over at UT Health East Texas, I built a really useful Python script that got ambulance and helicopter software ready to dispatch in 5 minutes instead of an hour -- paramedics still thank me for that one! And at UT Tyler, those dashboards I built? They became the official source for our national rankings. What I really like though, is breaking down the tech stuff -- my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@JoinTheQuery) channel teaches data skills to others who never thought they could *get* analytics. At the end of the day, I just like to make data work for people instead of the other way around.
