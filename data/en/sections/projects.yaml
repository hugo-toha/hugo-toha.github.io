- name: Stress-ng REST Server
  # logo: /images/sections/projects/tensorflow.png
  # role: Research Intern
  timeline: "July 2021 - September 2021"
  repo: https://github.com/shubhank-saxena/dnn-speech-recognizer
  #url: ""
  summary: This is a very basic Flask based REST server which takes in the stress-ng factors like compute, storage and network along with time and allows to run time-varying stress tests.
          stress-ng is an existing CLI tool. This project acts as a wrapper around it.

  # role: Research Intern
  timeline: "Jan 2021 - March 2021"
  repo: https://github.com/shubhank-saxena/dnn-speech-recognizer
  #url: ""
  summary: This project is a sign language alphabet recognizer using Python, OpenCV and TensorFlow for training the InceptionV3 model, a convolutional neural network model for classification.

- name: Speech Recognition DNN
  # logo: /images/sections/projects/tensorflow.png
  # role: Research Intern
  timeline: "August 2020 - October 2020"
  repo: https://github.com/shubhank-saxena/dnn-speech-recognizer
  #url: ""
  summary: Built a deep neural network that functions as part of end-to-end automatic speech recognition (ASR) pipeline. I used LibreSpeech dataset to train and evaluate models. This algorithm first converts any raw audio to feature representation that are commonly used for ASR, and then another network maps these audio features to transcribed text.

  # role: Research Intern
  timeline: "July 2020 - August 2020"
  # repo: https://github.com/shubhank-saxena/dnn-speech-recognizer
  #url: ""
  summary: This project is my introductory project to the world of Deep Learning. I trained an image classifier to recognize different species of flowers. I used Maria-Elena Nilsback and Andrew Zisserman's dataset of 102 flower categories(http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html) for training. The flowers are chosen to be flower commonly occurring in the United Kingdom. Each class consists of between 40 and 258 images.
          I used ResNet as my pre-trained model for feature extraction and the following structure is of the classifier model layers on top of it

- name: Fruit Ripeness classification
  # logo: /images/sections/projects/tensorflow.png
  role: Research Intern at IIIT Allahabad
  timeline: "May 2019 - July 2019"
  # repo: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow
  #url: ""
  summary: Using calibrated electronic sensors and Arduino board, I collected gaseous data and olfactory chemical substrates of various fruits. The fruit of every type was further in 3 categories of under-ripe, ripe and overripe. The overall outcome was a portable electronic nose like device which would predict the state of the fruit. The multiclass classification was used to achieve this task.

  role: Hackathon Project
  timeline: "March 2019 - April 2019"
  # repo: https://github.com/shubhank-saxena/dnn-speech-recognizer
  #url: ""
  summary: Developed a Flutter based cross platform for analysing and presenting the data which was given by CiSCO's Meraki Camera. Along with that, provided future prediction of queue analysis by implementing LSTM. Entire features and outcomes were also conveyed by Google Assistant and Alexa, along with automated messaging services in local language support for non-feature mobile phones.
          This ecosystem had provision for Admin warning in the form of automated SMS as well as generated mail.
