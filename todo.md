# Plan to resize certification badges

- [ ] In `layouts/partials/misc/badge.html`, add a class to the `img` tag to control its size.
- [ ] Add a style to the new class in `assets/styles/override.scss` to set the size of the certification badges to 25% of their current size.
- [ ] Review the changes and summarize them in this file.
