&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;A company that’s likely to make a substantial change in the status quo &amp;hellip; is thinking about a problem or a customer need in a way you’ve never heard before, but which makes perfect sense once you hear it.&amp;quot;&lt;p&gt;
—&lt;strong&gt;Tony Fadell&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59696349-build&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Build&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&#34;why-understand-our-goal-for-ideation&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why&lt;/strong&gt;: Understand Our Goal for Ideation&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideation is a muscle that we must train, similar to how we exercise our bodies to become stronger and healthier. Good ideas don&amp;rsquo;t simply come out of the blue or happen by chance. They are a result of consistent effort and practice. By generating multiple ideas and discerning whether they are good or bad, we can identify the necessary features for successful ideas and refine our ideation skills. This continuous exercise helps us build a strong foundation for innovation and creativity, enabling us to tackle challenges, seize opportunities with confidence, and frame solutions to problems in creative ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>The Art of Doing, Failing, and Learning</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;navigating-lifes-cycles-embracing-change-and-learning&#34;&gt;Navigating Life&amp;rsquo;s Cycles: Embracing Change and Learning&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Adulthood is your opportunity to screw up continually until you learn how to screw up a little bit less. (&amp;hellip;) Do, fail, learn. The rest will follow.&amp;quot;&lt;p&gt;
—&lt;strong&gt;Tony Fadell&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59696349-build&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Build&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the past decade, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to realize that my life has been a series of cycles: not knowing what I&amp;rsquo;m doing, choosing a reasonable next step, advancing as much as possible, noticing things aren&amp;rsquo;t entirely right, and starting again. The important aspect of these cycles is the presence of constants: my vision for my future and my values. These guiding principles help me evaluate options, seek advice, and make decisions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Do What Oughts to Be Done</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;trust-that-everything-will-work-out-in-the-end&#34;&gt;Trust that everything will work out in the end&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;I invoked my Tenth Commandment: ‘Do what ought to be done’.&amp;quot;&lt;p&gt;
—&lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Rubin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6398634-the-happiness-project&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Happiness Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December 2016, while volunteering in Curitiba, Brazil, I came across a saying that deeply resonated with me: “&lt;em&gt;tudo vai dar certo&lt;/em&gt;”, which translates to “everything will turn out right”. This phrase reflected my approach to situations, where I focused on making the right decisions and believed that favorable outcomes would follow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Knowledge Acquisition vs. Knowledge Production</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/posts/the_happiness_project/knowledge_acquisition_vs_knowledge_production/</link>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-should-i-spend-my-idle-time&#34;&gt;How should I spend my idle time?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Walking had an added benefit: it helped me to think. Nietzsche wrote, &lt;strong&gt;&amp;lsquo;All truly great thoughts are conceived while walking.&amp;rsquo;&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;&lt;br&gt;
—&lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Rubin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6398634-the-happiness-project&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Happiness Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since moving to Toronto, I&amp;rsquo;ve chosen biking as my preferred method of transportation. The benefits include a fair share of cardio, getting to places quickly, and the opportunity to listen to audiobooks or podcasts. However, the speed also means less time to make progress in my listening affairs. I&amp;rsquo;ve been considering whether walking is a better alternative, in other words, if the balance between travel time and time to read/listen should tilt towards the latter.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Being the Odd One Out</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-weird-in-a-good-way&#34;&gt;Be weird, in a good way&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;My sister said, ‘I don’t think you realize just how weird you are—but,’ she added hastily, ‘in a good way&amp;rsquo;.&amp;quot;&lt;p&gt;
—&lt;strong&gt;Gretchen Rubin&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6398634-the-happiness-project&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Happiness Project&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I often reflect on a particular phrase that captures my feelings of being different in a casual yet effective way. I&amp;rsquo;m usually the odd one out—the one who doesn&amp;rsquo;t get hot chocolate at a Christmas market because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t bring the same joy as my mom&amp;rsquo;s, or the one who stays quiet for hours at gatherings because I prefer discussing ideas and concepts rather than people. However, I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to embrace this uniqueness instead of running away from it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
