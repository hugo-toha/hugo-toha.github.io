### Trust that everything will work out in the end

> "I invoked my Tenth Commandment: ‘Do what ought to be done’."<p>
> —**Gretchen Rubin**, [_The Happiness Project_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6398634-the-happiness-project)

In December 2016, while volunteering in Curitiba, Brazil, I came across a saying that deeply resonated with me: “_tudo vai dar certo_”, which translates to “everything will turn out right”. This phrase reflected my approach to situations, where I focused on making the right decisions and believed that favorable outcomes would follow.

However, after encountering another phrase recently, I realized that the saying I cherished lacked a complementary aspect. The phrase “do what oughts to be done” perfectly summarizes the thought process I actually had.

As a non-native English speaker, I sometimes notice nuances in language that might seem trivial to others. For instance, the auxiliary verb "ought" carries a sense of moral responsibility, unlike "have" or "should", which respectively suggest breakable obligations and recommendations. This sense of moral responsibility helps eliminate the common question, "do I really _have_ to?" and reassures me that, since it's my responsibility to act in a certain way, there's no other option than to follow through. By doing what needs to be done, I trust that _tudo vai dar certo_ in the end.
